<p>The UNO-Recoletos highschool de Talisay or currently the Colegio San Nicolas de Tolentino Recoletos was jointly founded by the Recollect Fathers in the town of Talisay who lived and worked in the parish associated in the educational and religious life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was when the parish priest Rev. Fr. Florentino Echavarri, OAR, whose efforts and dream were conceived to put a school in the poblacion, a plan which was supported by the parishioners and upon the approval of the Mayor of Talisay, Hon Mario T. Lizares, that plan was realized. On January 1, 1971, the cornerstone laying took place before a crowd of Recollect Fathers and the town officials. Pn the same year, the school building had really been constructed and situated along churchyard. Bishop Antonio Y. Fortich of Bacolod City officiated the inauguration on June 15, 1971 and was witnessed by the Recollect community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UNO-R Talisay stared its classes which were composed of two sections with 90 freshmen students with their teaching personnel. As years went on, the trust and confident of the parents showed the spirit, which calls for expansion. The pioneer Recollect administrators were composed of Recollect fathers: Rev. Fr. Florentino Echavarri, the first Rector, Rev. Fr. Dioniso Gutierrez, the Treasurer and the Rev. Fr. Jesus P. Recio as the Sports Moderator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To cope with the students&rsquo; populace, additional rooms and facilities were constructed; concrete walls were built around the area for student&rsquo;s security and privacy of the school itself. The major trust of the school was the strong implementation of Discipline as essential elements towards the attainment of common good. Moreover, religious instruction re-enforced instruction as the core of the curriculum, and became the mainstream of the institution, thus, setting its reputation as the only private catholic school in the municipality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like any other growing school, the turn of years brought tremendous achievements to the school both in cultural and academic fields. Its consistent development and growth garnered innumerable citations more importantly in civic and literary competitions. Another phase of great change in the school was during the 90&rsquo;s and year 2000, where there is an ongoing improvement in the provisions of infrastructure of the school&rsquo;s physical plant as well as the modern facilities, which have been provided and expanded.</p>
<p>To be more responsive to the needs of growing populace, the school has established strong student personnel services, campus ministry clubs, guidance program, computer studies, sports engagements, cultural guild, faculty development program and has organized an active alumni association as well, in consonance with the school&rsquo;s mission statement, of producing young individuals and responsible citizenry who have imbibed upon themselves Quality Catholic Christian &nbsp;and Community-Oriented Education.</p>
